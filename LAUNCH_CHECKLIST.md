# Launch Checklist

This checklist tracks the governance, marketing, and engineering feedback for the public ZT-Infra adapter launch.

## Governance And Continuity

| Item | Status | Solution / Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONTRIBUTING guide with setup, PR process, and coding standards | Done | [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) now documents environment setup, local checks, coding standards, broker rules, policy template rules, and PR standards. |
| Good First Issue backlog | Done | GitHub issues [#4](https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world/issues/5), and [#6](https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world/issues/6). |
| 90-day roadmap status | Done | [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) includes Phase 1 status and a 90-Day Launch Status table. |
| GitHub Project board | Blocked | `gh project create` requires `project,read:project` token scopes. Run `gh auth refresh -s project,read:project`, then create the board. |
| Nono role/status | Done | [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md), [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md), and [brokers/nono-cli/README.md](./brokers/nono-cli/README.md) state that Nono is an optional Execution Broker, not the identity or policy layer. |
| Community hub | Done | Discord channel `Zero Trust Infrastructure` is linked from [COMMUNITY.md](./COMMUNITY.md), README, and the homepage: https://discord.gg/cDS8MPX6G. |
| Defined Phase 1 ready criteria | Done | [PHASE1_READY.md](./PHASE1_READY.md) separates ready, experimental, planned, and non-claimable capabilities. |
| Risk register | Done | [RISK_REGISTER.md](./RISK_REGISTER.md) documents performance, policy bypass, microVM isolation, secret exposure, DAAL, and ownership risks. |
| Role clarification | Done | [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) lists alpha maintenance roles and current owners. |

## Narrative And Conversion

| Item | Status | Solution / Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulnerability hook | Done | Homepage now shows the broad API key failure mode, names prompt injection as out of scope, and explains deny-before-execute as the mitigation. [CASE_STUDIES.md](./CASE_STUDIES.md) adds concrete examples. |
| Newsletter / lead capture | Done | Homepage includes a Buttondown-powered "Join the Alpha" form for `oscarmackjr`. |
| One-sentence pitch | Done | README and [LAUNCH_BRIEF.md](./LAUNCH_BRIEF.md): "Open-source identity, policy, and audit evidence for autonomous AI agents." |
| Social kit | Done | [SOCIAL_KIT.md](./SOCIAL_KIT.md) includes Hacker News, LinkedIn, X, approved claims, and claims to avoid. [LAUNCH_BRIEF.md](./LAUNCH_BRIEF.md) keeps the narrative brief. |
| Branding sync | Partial | Website and README share narrative and architecture assets. A reusable wordmark/logo remains planned. |
| ROI metrics | Done | [ROI_METRICS.md](./ROI_METRICS.md) explains cost avoidance, operational metrics, and business value. |
| Engagement strategy | Done | [ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md](./ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md) documents GitHub Traffic, Discord, Buttondown, Vercel, and future npm measurement loops. |
| Authority positioning | Done | [ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md](./ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md) positions the project alongside Zero Trust principles and NIST SP 800-207 as influence, not certification. |

## Technical Trust And Security

| Item | Status | Solution / Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Five-minute quickstart | Done | [README.md](./README.md) includes Node and Docker Compose paths. `docker compose config` passes. Full Compose runtime needs Docker daemon running. |
| Decentralized audit integration proof | Partial | `zt-audit verify` exists for local audit-shaped records. Base Sepolia MVP evidence is published in [EXPLORER_VERIFICATION.md](./EXPLORER_VERIFICATION.md); production reconciliation remains planned. |
| Apache-2.0 license | Done | [LICENSE](./LICENSE), [NOTICE](./NOTICE), `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` now use Apache-2.0. README and homepage surface the license prominently. |
| SECURITY.md | Done | [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) exists and GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled. |
| Repo cleanup | Done | Public repo excludes `.env`, `.terraform`, Terraform state, logs, and dependencies. |
| Secret scanning | Done | GitHub secret scanning and push protection are enabled. Local tracked-file scan found no obvious secrets. |
| SDK documentation | Done | README, [SDK_REVIEW.md](./SDK_REVIEW.md), and [SDK_API.md](./SDK_API.md) document usage, API shape, helper methods, and fail-closed behavior. |
| Branch protection | Done | `main` requires PR review, required `test`, stale review dismissal, admin enforcement, conversation resolution, no force pushes, and no deletions. |
| Automated scans | Done | CI includes tests, npm audit, dependency review, CodeQL, and Dependabot. |
| SBOM generation | Done | CI uploads a CycloneDX SBOM artifact and `npm run sbom` works locally. |
| Local secret scan | Done | `npm run security:secrets` scans tracked files for common cloud, AI, wallet, and private key patterns. |
| Incident response plan | Done | [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) defines severity, war-room roles, freeze actions, and recovery criteria. |
| Release notes | Done | [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) exists and is exposed through `/docs/changelog`. |

## Latest Validation

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | 31 tests passed |
| `npm audit --omit=dev` | 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run security:secrets` | Passed; added to CI. |
| `npm run sbom` | Passed; produces ignored `sbom.cdx.json` and CI artifact. |
| `docker compose config` | Passed |
| `docker compose up -d` | Blocked locally because Docker daemon was not running |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |
