# Zero Trust Hello World Adapter

This is the public starter repository for developers building adapters against the Zero Trust V2 infrastructure.

It is intentionally small: a Node.js Hello World service plus one demo call to the Zero Trust Control Plane.

**Tagline:** Open-source identity, policy, and audit evidence for autonomous AI agents.

## Launch Trust Signals

- **License:** Apache-2.0, chosen for enterprise-friendly infrastructure adoption and explicit patent grant language.
- **Community:** Join the `Zero Trust Infrastructure` Discord: <https://discord.gg/cDS8MPX6G>.
- **Explorer verification:** DAAL smart contract explorer verification is tracked in [EXPLORER_VERIFICATION.md](./EXPLORER_VERIFICATION.md). Base Sepolia MVP evidence is published, including direct and batched AWS smoke transactions. Production all-log claims remain pending until source mapping, reconciliation, alerting, and repeatable verifier automation are complete.

## Vision

We are building toward a SPIFFE-like identity, policy, and attestation layer for AI agents.

Autonomous systems are starting to discover tools, call APIs, write code, open tickets, deploy infrastructure, and act across organizational boundaries. The next decade of autonomous system security will need portable agent identity, least-privilege policy, verifiable execution context, and audit records that survive framework churn.

This repository is the public on-ramp for contributors who want to help define that layer. Start with the five-minute Hello World path, then help harden the standards, adapters, brokers, trust bundles, and conformance tests that make agent actions safe to delegate.

## Who this is for

Use this repo if you are:

- a junior developer learning how adapters connect to Zero Trust V2;
- an integration partner testing the public adapter contract;
- an end-user adapter author who needs a safe starting point.

## Five-Minute Secure Hello World

This quickstart shows the full security loop:

1. spin up a local Zero Trust control plane;
2. register a mock agent;
3. attempt an unauthorized execution and fail;
4. apply a policy;
5. execute a safe Hello World action successfully.

The local control plane is a mock for onboarding. It uses the same `/actions` request/response shape as the MVP, but its signatures are marked `MOCK_ECDSA_SHA_256`. For real infrastructure, point `ZT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` at a deployed ZT-Infra control plane.

### Option A: Docker Compose

Use this path if you want the fewest local prerequisites:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world.git
cd zt-adapter-hello-world
docker compose up
```

Docker Desktop or another Docker daemon must be running before you start the stack.

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/deny
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/policies/allow \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"hello-world.say_hello","reason":"Quickstart policy allows hello world."}'
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/allow
```

Expected result:

- `/demo/deny` returns `decision: "deny"` and skips execution.
- `/demo/allow` returns `decision: "allow"` after the policy is applied.

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Option B: Local Node.js

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world.git
cd zt-adapter-hello-world
npm ci
npm test
npm run security:secrets
npm run sbom
```

### 2. Start local zt-infra mock

Terminal 1:

```bash
npm run zt:mock
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3000/health | jq .
```

### 3. Register a mock agent

Terminal 2:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"actor":"hello-world-agent"}' | jq .
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "actor": "hello-world-agent",
  "registered": true
}
```

### 4. Attempt unauthorized execution

This action is intentionally dangerous and should fail:

```bash
npm run demo:deny
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": 403,
  "decision": "deny",
  "reason": "Mock policy blocks infrastructure termination.",
  "audit": {
    "kms_signature": {
      "algorithm": "MOCK_ECDSA_SHA_256"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Apply policy and execute successfully

Allow only the safe Hello World action:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/policies/allow \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"hello-world.say_hello","reason":"Quickstart policy allows hello world."}' | jq .
```

Then execute:

```bash
npm run demo:allow
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": 200,
  "decision": "allow",
  "executionSkipped": false,
  "result": {
    "message": "Hello from a policy-approved adapter action."
  }
}
```

### 6. Run the web adapter

Terminal 3:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/deny
http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/allow
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Optional: Docker Compose v2 for the containerized quickstart
- Optional: `jq` for prettier terminal output

## Deploy To Vercel

This repo is Vercel-ready. The browser homepage is served from `/`, and JSON demo endpoints remain available under the same paths.

The homepage includes a Buttondown-powered "Join the Alpha" form. It posts directly to Buttondown and does not store email addresses in this app.

1. Import the GitHub repo into Vercel:

```text
https://github.com/oscarmackjr-twg/zt-adapter-hello-world
```

2. Use the default Vercel Node.js settings. No build command is required.

3. Optional environment variables:

```text
ZT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=https://your-control-plane.example.com
ZT_ACTOR=hello-world-agent
ZT_TOKEN=optional-bearer-token
```

Without `ZT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`, the homepage and `/health` still render, while `/demo/deny` and `/demo/allow` return a clear `503` explaining that a control plane is not configured.

Vercel routing is defined in [vercel.json](./vercel.json), with the serverless entry point in [api/index.js](./api/index.js).

## Real zt-infra

The five-minute flow uses `npm run zt:mock`.

To use the real MVP control plane:

1. deploy ZT-Infra from the private infrastructure repo;
2. confirm `zt-provisioner` is reachable through SSM or Tailscale;
3. set:

```bash
ZT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
ZT_ACTOR=hello-world-agent
```

The real control plane signs audit records with AWS KMS and writes to the configured audit sink.

## Demo Endpoints

The adapter app exposes:

```text
GET /            hello response
GET /health      service health
GET /demo/deny   unauthorized action, expected deny
GET /demo/allow  safe action, expected allow after policy is applied
```

Denied response shape:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": 403,
  "decision": "deny",
  "reason": "...",
  "audit": {
    "previous_hash": "...",
    "current_hash": "...",
    "kms_signature": {
      "algorithm": "ECDSA_SHA_256"
    }
  }
}
```

## SDK-Style Usage

This repo includes a tiny public client inspired by the first-customer SDK draft, adapted to the current MVP `/actions` API.

```js
import { ZeroTrustClient } from "./src/zero-trust-client.js";

const zt = new ZeroTrustClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
  actor: "hello-world-agent",
});

const decision = await zt.guardedCall({
  action: "aws.ec2.terminate_instances",
  resource: "i-demo",
  fn: async () => {
    return "this only runs if policy allows";
  },
});

console.log(decision);
```

Helper methods are included for common adapter surfaces:

```js
await zt.langGraph({ action, nodeName });
await zt.openAIResponses({ action, responseId });
await zt.mcpToolCall({ toolName, resource });
await zt.a2aTask({ externalAgent, resource });
```

Adapters that need a stable evidence summary can normalize signed audit and DAAL fields:

```js
const evidence = zt.auditEvidence(decision);
console.log(evidence.daalTransactionLink);
```

See [SDK_REVIEW.md](./SDK_REVIEW.md) for notes on how this differs from the draft first-customer SDK.

## Adapter Contract

See [ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md](./ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md).

For identity provisioning, ABAC examples, and audit record semantics, see [IDENTITY_AND_POLICY.md](./IDENTITY_AND_POLICY.md).

## Execution Brokers

Execution Brokers run approved work after the control plane returns `allow`.

Examples planned for this public repo:

- Docker Local Execution Broker: [brokers/docker-local](./brokers/docker-local)
- Nono CLI Execution Broker: [brokers/nono-cli](./brokers/nono-cli)
- AWS Lambda Execution Broker
- Kubernetes Job Execution Broker

The current engineering spec for broker IaC and repository hardening is in [ENGINEERING_SPEC.md](./ENGINEERING_SPEC.md).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the broker contract.

## Audit Verification CLI

The repo includes a small verifier for audit-shaped decision responses:

```bash
npx zt-audit verify audit.json
```

or from a local checkout:

```bash
node bin/zt-audit.js verify audit.json
```

The verifier checks required actor/action/decision fields, hash-chain fields, signature metadata, and canonical hash consistency for the public demo record format. Production KMS signature verification is planned work.

## Public IaC Example

The public Terraform example deploys an IAM-authorized Lambda Authorization Gateway skeleton:

```bash
cd infra/terraform/examples/authorization-gateway
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The function URL requires AWS IAM/SigV4 authorization. It is not an anonymous public endpoint.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

Phase 2 focuses on secure service identity:

- mTLS
- SPIFFE/SPIRE integration
- workload identity mapping to `actor`

## Stable Releases

Stable versions are published as GitHub releases and tags:

```text
v0.1.0
```

Use releases when linking from public websites or tutorials.

## License

This repository is licensed under Apache-2.0. The project uses Apache-2.0 instead of MIT for the public adapter because infrastructure and security adopters usually expect explicit patent grant language.

See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [NOTICE](./NOTICE).

## Terminal Demo Recording

The repository includes an asciinema recording of the five-minute flow:

```text
recordings/agent-blocked-then-authorized.cast
```

It also includes a Nono Execution Broker recording:

```text
recordings/nono-sandbox-demo.cast
```

The website embeds both recordings on `/demo` and serves the public player sources from:

```text
public/agent-blocked-then-authorized.cast
public/nono-sandbox-demo.cast
```

To regenerate them:

```bash
asciinema rec --overwrite -c "npm run demo:record" recordings/agent-blocked-then-authorized.cast
asciinema rec --overwrite -c "npm run demo:record:nono" recordings/nono-sandbox-demo.cast
```

## Security

Do not commit secrets. Keep `.env` local.

Report vulnerabilities privately. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

For design-level security boundaries, see [THREAT_MODEL.md](./THREAT_MODEL.md).
For launch risks and incident handling, see [RISK_REGISTER.md](./RISK_REGISTER.md) and [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md).

This adapter is a learning repo, not a production agent runtime.
